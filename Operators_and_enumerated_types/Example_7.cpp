"Operators"	                                "^ | & ~ << >>"
May be implemented as a global function?	YES
May be implemented as a member function?	YES
Type of return value	                    Depending on context

All of the above operators, except the ~ are binary.
Resist the temptation to overload the ^ operator for an exponentiation, like in FORTRAN or Python programming languages and in some spreadsheets.
The real exponentiation has a very high priority (higher than the * operator), while the ^ has a priority lower than other arithmetic operators. 
It may bring along some unexpected and undesired side effects.
