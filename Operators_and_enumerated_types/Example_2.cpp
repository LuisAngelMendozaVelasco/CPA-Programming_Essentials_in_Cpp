///////////////////////////////
// Improving the << operator //
///////////////////////////////

/*
There are two different ways of using the “<<” operator: one implemented by us and one we got from the streams library.
Stream operators may be chained like this:
    cout << i << endl;
Our operators aren’t that smart (yet). It’ll provoke a whole load of compilation errors.
The line we is interpreted by the compiler in the following way:
    (cout << i) << endl;
The expression inside the parentheses returns a reference to a stream (namely: the cout stream) so it can be used (reused) as a left argument for the next "<<" in a chain.
We can do the same thing with our stack, but it means that the operator functions may not be void anymore. They have to return a value as a reference 
to the stack object – the same object for which the operators were activated for the first time.
