The code shows a class that doesnâ€™t have a constructor at all. We are aware of all the possible hazards connected with the use of uninitialized objects.
The class will be implicitly equipped with the so-called implicit default (parameter-less) constructor but the constructor will do nothing at all. 
Our will will be wilful indeed!
