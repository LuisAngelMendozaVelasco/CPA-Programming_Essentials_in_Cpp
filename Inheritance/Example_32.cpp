/* 
The explicit copying constructor (written by us) has invoked none of the component’s copying constructors. Unfortunately, defining our own 
copying constructor means we assume full responsibility for all the activities needed to carry out responsible copying. 
This means that we need to modify the constructor. One way to do this is to add a line like this one:
    Compo(Compo &src) : f1(src.f1), f2(src.f2)
    { 
        cout << "Copying Compo..." << endl; 
    }
instead of
    Compo(Compo &src)
    { 
        cout << "Copying Compo..." << endl; 
    }
