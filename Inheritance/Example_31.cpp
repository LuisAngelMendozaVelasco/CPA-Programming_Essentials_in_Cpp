The Compo class doesn’t have a copying constructor. This means that the compiler will generate an implicit copying constructor for the class.
This constructor copies the objects bit by bit.
Besides its normal activity (the cloning), the copying constructor takes into consideration all the existing copying constructors 
(implicit and explicit) defined within the objects used to compose the class. This gives a chance to copy the components in the most appropriate way.
