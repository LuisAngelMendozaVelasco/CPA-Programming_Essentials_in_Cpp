/*
A function may be a class’s friend too. Such a function may access all the private and/or protected components of the class.
The rules are a bit different:
    * a friendship declaration must contain a complete prototype of the friend function (including return type); a function with the same name, 
      but incompatible in the sense of the parameters’ conformance, will not be recognized as a friend.
    * a class may have many friend functions.
    * a function may be a friend of many classes.
    * a class may recognize as friends both global and member functions.
