//////////////////////////
// Explicit conversions //
//////////////////////////

/*
In general, the C++ language give us three ways to specify explicit conversions:
    * the so-called functional notation, which is a native (but currently obsoleted) C++ syntax convention 
    (named because of its similarity to the well-known function invocation); in this case the name of a new (target) 
    type is treated like a function and the conversion takes the following form:
        new_type_name(expression_of_old_type)

    * the so-called C-style casting (named after the C++ predecessor, the C programming language, 
    which used, and still uses, a syntax of that kind); in this case, we specify the conversion in the following form:
        (new_type_name) expression_of_old_type

    * the so-called static casting, a native and currently recognized as recommended C++ syntax convention 
    where the conversion is done by an operator named static_cast; the operator takes the following form:
        static_cast<new_type_name>(expression_of_old_type)
