///////////////////////////
// Renaming a name space //
///////////////////////////

/*
It may happen that one of the name spaces you have or want to use has an inconvenient name (for any reason). 
We can rename it locally i.e. it'll be recognized under its new name only in the source file where the act of renaming has occurred.
We can use it with a special form of the namespace statement - here it is:
    namespace new_name = old_name;
The new name of the name space may be used together with the old one. This means that the renaming is actually aliasing, since both of the names are still valid.
