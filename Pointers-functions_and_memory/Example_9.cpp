/* 
In a funtion the parameter's value doesn't replace the argument's value upon return from the function. 
We can say that the argument has a one-way ticket: it transports a value to the function and doesn't take it up to the invoker.
Don't forget that. This way of communication is based on transferring a value from the invoker to the function. 
And thatâ€™s why this method is called passing parameters by value.
