/*
The throw statement is obligated to throw a value e.g. an object – it can’t throw nothing. Throw is able to throw any object of any accessible class. 
We also know that the type of the object thrown may be used to choose the catch which will be responsible for handling the exception.

These two applications have nothing in common! We want to show that these two paths (routine and exceptional) go completely separately.
