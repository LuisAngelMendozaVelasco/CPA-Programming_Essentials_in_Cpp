#include "mystack.h" -> This is how the compiler learns about the stack and all of its components, as well as the exceptions we’ve jointly defined.
The compilation process should look as follows:
    * The compiler compiles the “mystack.cpp” file and produces an object file (its name may be different on different platforms – some compilers may use “mystack.o”, 
    others “mystack.obj” – don’t be surprised).
    * The compiler compiles the “main.cpp” file and produces an object file of a name, e.g. “main.obj”
    * The linker links both files, adding a code taken from standard libraries, and produces an executable file in the end.
