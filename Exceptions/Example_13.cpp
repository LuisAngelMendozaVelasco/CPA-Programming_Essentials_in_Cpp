// The 'explicit' keyword //

/*
The explicit keyword may be placed in front of a class’s constructor declaration. It protects the constructor from being used in any context requiring the use of implicit conversions. 
This constructor may only be used in an explicit way; hence, the keyword is used when a programmer wants to avoid any side effects that may result from the reckless use of the selected 
constructors, or indeed of all constructors.

/* 
There are two very similar classes, named A and B, respectively. They’re both dummies, in fact – they do nothing at all. 
They’re almost identical, the only difference comes from the constructor declaration: the A class makes use of the explicit keyword, while the B class doesn’t.

   public:
      explicit A(int) {}

/* 
The syntax used in both lines is implicitly presumed as it’s coded in the following way:
   A a(1);
but when the explicit keyword is used, this presumption is illegal.
The A class cannot implicitly convert integers into its objects.
