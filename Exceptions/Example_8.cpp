/* 
Throw and how we can find out about it

We can learn about it from reading the function body, but that isn’t a good idea. There are two important arguments worth considering:
    * The function may be very long and very complex – reading it may be time consuming and we may overlook some of the throw statements
    * The source code of the function may be inaccessible – it may happen if we use a ready-made library, written by other authors, 
      when we’ve compiled (binary) files containing only executable code and header files specifying function’s headers but not the bodies.
